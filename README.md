# Santa Node helper
This my solution to part 1 and part 2 of 2015 Advent of Code challenge day 1. You can find more details [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) 

The puzzle input contains opening parenthesis, (, and a closing parenthesis, ).

##  Part 1

The goal is to find what floor do the instructions take Santa. An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

##  Part 2

The goal is to find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1)
